          <h2>What’s the Difference Between Git and GitHub?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Git is the tool that will let you create a local repository (on your PC) and manage versions of your files
            </li>
            <li>GitHub is an online service that will host your Git repositories (in the cloud)</li>
          </ul>
    

    
          <h2>What’s the Difference Between Fork and Clone?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>FORK</strong> creates a copy from another user to your REMOTE repository</li>
            <li><strong>CLONE</strong> creates a copy from your REMOTE repository to your LOCAL repository</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2>Git Bash commands</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ls</strong> # List folders / files in the current directory</li>
            <li><strong>pwd</strong> # Provides the path of current directory</li>
            <li><strong>cd</strong> # Change directory</li>
            <li><strong>mkdir</strong> # Make a directory (folder)</li>
            <li><strong>touch</strong> # Make a file</li>
            <li><strong>clear</strong> # Clear the screen</li>
            <li><strong>status</strong> # Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see
              which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.</li>
            <li><strong>add</strong> # To add working file(s) to staging</li>
            <li><strong>commit</strong> # Captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots
              can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
            </li>
            <li><strong>push</strong> # To push staging repo UP to remote repo</li>
            <li><strong>pull</strong> # To pull remote repo DOWN to staging repo</li>
            <li><strong>rm -r NAME_OF_DIR</strong> # -r stands for recursive</li>
            <li><strong>code .</strong> # Opens up VS Code in the current directory</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h2>How to create a repository in GitHub.</h2>
          <ol>
